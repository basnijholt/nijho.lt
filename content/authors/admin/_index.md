Hi, my name is Bas. I am a: Python and [open-source <em class="fab fa-github fa-fw" style="margin-right: 0.2em;"> </em>](https://github.com/basnijholt) enthusiast, [Ph.D. <em class="fa fa-graduation-cap fa-fw" style="margin-right: 0.2em;"> </em> in theoretical quantum mechanics](https://github.com/basnijholt/thesis), and full-time nerd. I live in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.

[Here <em class="fab fa-instagram fa-fw" style="margin-right: 0.2em;"> </em>](http://instagram.com/bnijholt) (or [here <em class="fab fa-500px fa-fw"> </em>](https://500px.com/basnijholt)) are some pretty pictures that I took, [this <em class="fa fa-university fa-fw" style="margin-right: 0.2em;"> </em>](http://quantumtinkerer.tudelft.nl/) is where I did my Ph.D., I work [here <em class="fab fa-microsoft fa-fw"> </em>](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum), and see my [LinkedIn <em class="fab fa-linkedin fa-fw" style="margin-right: 0.2em;"> </em>](https://www.linkedin.com/in/basnijholt) for some technical details on my daily activities.
