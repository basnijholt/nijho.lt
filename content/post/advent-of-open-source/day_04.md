(See my [intro post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/basnijholt_advent-of-open-source-celebrating-activity-7269075513002909697-M89J))

While I absolutely love my work at IonQ, I believe I'll love it even more when my family's livelihood doesn't depend on it. That's the dream of financial independence - doing what you love because you want to, not because you have to. This led me to create WenFire, a financial independence calculator that helps answer the eternal questions: "When can I retire?" and "How many days of extra work will that new iPhone or car cost me?"

## 📖 Origin Story

There are many retirement calculators out there, but they all made assumptions I didn't quite agree with (and I'm sure others won't agree with my assumptions either!). I wanted something that matched my specific views on salary growth and investment returns. Plus, I had been itching to learn more about building web applications, so this project let me explore FastAPI, htmx, and Vega-Lite while solving a personal need.

## 🔧 Technical Highlights

- Built with FastAPI and Bootstrap
- Interactive visualizations using Vega-Lite
- Responsive and mobile-friendly design
- Customizable assumptions for:
  - Investment growth
  - Inflation rates
  - Salary increases
  - Safe withdrawal rates
- Allows parameter changes at certain dates
- Calculate retirement impact of one-time expenses
- All parameters are encoded in the URL for easy sharing

## 📊 Impact

While this project only has 3 GitHub stars, its real value is personal - it helps me track my own journey to financial independence. It's also been a great learning experience in web development, an area where I had little prior experience.

## 🎯 Challenges and Solutions

- Learning web development from scratch
- Creating intuitive visualizations for financial data
- Balancing simplicity with customization options
- Making reasonable default assumptions
- Ensuring mobile responsiveness

## 💡 Lessons Learned

1. Financial modeling requires careful consideration of assumptions
2. Web development is a different beast from scientific computing
3. Sometimes the best way to learn new tech is to solve a personal problem
4. The best calculator is the one that matches your own assumptions
