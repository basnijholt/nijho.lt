I'm doing an advent calendar of open source projects (24 days in December), where I share one of my open source projects each day. I'm the author of 30+ open source projects, ranging from small utilities to large frameworks. Some have thousands of users, others just a few. Some took hours to create, others years.
The posts follow this general structure but can be adjusted as needed:
1. Introduction/hook that relates to the specific project
2. Origin Story - why I created it
3. Technical Highlights - key features
4. Impact - users, stars, real-world usage
5. Challenges and Solutions
6. Lessons Learned
The tone is:
- Humble but proud of the work
- Technical but accessible
- Including some light humor where appropriate
- Focused on real impact and lessons
- Concise and to the point
Each post needs two versions:
1. Markdown format for my blog
2. LinkedIn-friendly format (no markdown, using â€¢ instead of *, etc.)
