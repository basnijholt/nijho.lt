(See my [intro post](../))

Sometimes the smallest tools solve the most persistent problems. Today's project is about taming automatic parallelization in scientific computing - a deceptively simple challenge that has cost countless CPU hours.

## 📖 Origin Story

While working on high-performance computing clusters, I frequently encountered a counterintuitive problem: code running slower on multiple CPU cores than on a single one. Many scientific libraries (NumPy, SciPy) automatically parallelize operations, which sounds great but can actually harm performance when you're already parallelizing at a higher level. After repeatedly explaining to colleagues why they needed to set various environment variables to disable this behavior, I created numthreads to solve it once and for all.

## 🔧 Technical Highlights

- Controls thread count for major numerical libraries:
  - OpenBLAS
  - Intel's Math Kernel Library (MKL)
  - OpenMP
  - NumExpr
  - Accelerate
- Zero dependencies
- Tiny (≤7KB) yet solves a real problem
- Both CLI and Python API

## 📊 Impact

Over my scientific computing career, I've encountered this threading issue dozens of times. Since creating this package a year ago, I've helped at least 5 different researchers speed up their workflows, sometimes by orders of magnitude. The beauty lies in its simplicity - the fix is often as simple as:

```bash
eval $(numthreads 1)
```

## 💡 Lessons Learned

1. The simplest solutions are often the best
2. More cores doesn't always mean faster code
3. If you find yourself repeating the same instructions, write a tool
4. Even a 7KB package can save hours of computing time
