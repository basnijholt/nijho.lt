# üéÑüéÅ Advent of Open Source ‚Äì Day 24/24: Home Assistant Ecosystem üè†

(See my [intro post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/basnijholt_advent-of-open-source-celebrating-activity-7269075513002909697-M89J))

There are not enough days in this advent calendar to highlight all my projects. So today is a collection of Home Assistant-related packages. Each has its own story, showcasing the power of open source to enhance our daily lives.

## üìñ Origin Stories

My journey into Home Assistant started with a simple desire: to control my home with code. This led to several projects, each solving a unique problem:

-   **aiokef**: I wanted to control my high-end KEF speakers through Home Assistant. After reverse-engineering the network packets, I figured out how to send commands by decoding the raw byte sequences, effectively "speaking" the speaker's language.
-   **miflora**: When @ChristianKuehnel, the original author of this plant sensor library, couldn't maintain it anymore, he transferred ownership to me. Now, this package helps countless users monitor their plants' health through Home Assistant.
-   **addon-otmonitor**: This Docker container packages OpenTherm Monitor, a powerful tool interfacing with the OpenTherm Gateway (OTGW). Essentially, it's a fully open-source alternative to commercial smart thermostats like Nest or Ecobee, giving users complete control over their heating systems.
-   **home-assistant-macbook-touch-bar**: Remember those short-lived MacBook Touch Bars? Instead of letting it gather dust, I turned it into a mini Home Assistant control panel, making it surprisingly useful for controlling my home's lights, temperature, and more.
-   **python-kasa**:  The most popular library to control TP-Link smart home products used to be `pyHS100`. To modernize it, I converted the entire library to use `asyncio`. Together with other frequent contributors (@rytilahti), we created the `python-kasa` organization and repository. While I haven't contributed much since its inception, it has grown into the go-to library for controlling TP-Link Kasa devices.

## üîß Technical Highlights

These projects showcase a variety of skills and technologies:

-   **Network Reverse Engineering**: `aiokef` involved deep dives into network traffic, understanding proprietary protocols, and writing code to interact with hardware at a low level.
-   **Community Collaboration**: `miflora` and `python-kasa` exemplify how open source projects can thrive through community handovers and collaborative development, ensuring continued growth even when original authors move on.
-   **Dockerization**: `addon-otmonitor` demonstrates how Docker can simplify the deployment of complex tools, making them easily accessible within the Home Assistant ecosystem.
-   **Hardware Hacking**: `home-assistant-macbook-touch-bar` turned an underutilized piece of hardware into a useful interface, extending the reach of Home Assistant.

## üìä Impact

Collectively, these projects are used by many thousands of users in the Home Assistant community. They've enabled:

-   Seamless integration of KEF speakers into smart home setups.
-   Automated plant care with real-time sensor data.
-   Open-source control over heating systems, promoting energy efficiency.
-   A new use for an otherwise forgotten piece of hardware.
-   Reliable control of TP-Link Kasa devices within Home Assistant, making it a cornerstone of many smart home setups.

## üí° Lessons Learned

-   Open source allows us to take control of our technology.
-   Reverse engineering can unlock hidden functionalities.
-   Community collaboration keeps projects alive and thriving.
-   Even seemingly useless hardware can be repurposed.
-   Docker makes complex deployments simple.
-   Modernizing existing libraries (like with `asyncio`) can significantly improve their performance and usability.
