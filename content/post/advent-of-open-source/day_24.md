# üéÑüéÅ Advent of Open Source ‚Äì Day 24/24: Home Assistant Ecosystem üè†

(See my [intro post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/basnijholt_advent-of-open-source-celebrating-activity-7269075513002909697-M89J))

There are not enough days in this advent calendar to highlight all my projects. So today is a collection of IoT/Home Assistant-related packages. Each has its own story.

## üìñ Origin Stories

My Home Assistant obsession began as described in Day 10. Many projects emerged from this hobby:

- **aiokef**: To control my KEF speakers, I reverse-engineered network packets and decoded raw byte sequences to "speak" the speaker's language.
- **miflora**: When @ChristianKuehnel couldn't maintain this plant sensor library anymore, he transferred it to me. Now it still helps users monitor plant health.
- **addon-otmonitor**: This HA add-on packages OpenTherm Monitor for the OpenTherm Gateway (OTGW). It's an open-source alternative to Nest or Ecobee, giving full control over heating systems.
- **home-assistant-macbook-touch-bar**: I transformed the short-lived MacBook Touch Bar into a mini Home Assistant control panel for lights, temperature, and more.
- **python-kasa**: To modernize the popular `pyHS100` library for TP-Link devices, I converted it to use `asyncio`. With @rytilahti, we created the `python-kasa` organization. While I haven't contributed much since its inception, now it's the standard for controlling Kasa devices.

## üîß Technical Highlights

- **Network Reverse Engineering**: `aiokef` involved deep dives into network traffic, understanding the sequences of 1s and 0s to interact with hardware.
- **Community Collaboration**: `miflora` and `python-kasa` show how open source projects can thrive through community handovers and collaborative development, ensuring continued growth even when original authors move on.
- **Dockerization**: `addon-otmonitor` demonstrates how Docker can simplify the deployment of complex tools.
- **Hardware Hacking**: `home-assistant-macbook-touch-bar` turned an useless piece of hardware into a useful interface, extending the reach of Home Assistant.

## üìä Impact & Lessons
These projects serve thousands of users while teaching valuable lessons:
- Open source empowers us: from KEF speaker integration to plant monitoring
- Reverse engineering unlocks potential: turning proprietary protocols into open solutions
- Community drives success: projects like miflora and python-kasa thrive through collaboration
- Innovation through repurposing: giving new life to hardware like the MacBook Touch Bar
- Modern tech matters: Docker simplifies deployment, async code boosts performance
