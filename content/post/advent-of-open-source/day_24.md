(See my [intro post](../))

There are not enough days in this advent calendar to highlight all my projects. So today is a collection of IoT/Home Assistant-related packages. Each has its own story.

## üìñ Origin Stories & Technical Details

My Home Assistant obsession began as described in [Day 10](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/basnijholt_opensource-homeassistant-smarthome-activity-7272248713882820608-w7RV). Many projects emerged from this hobby:

- **aiokef**: To control my KEF speakers, I reverse-engineered network traffic and decoded raw byte sequences, diving deep into proprietary protocols to "speak" the speaker's language.
- **miflora**: When @ChristianKuehnel couldn't maintain this plant sensor library anymore, he transferred it to me. A perfect example of open source collaboration, it continues to help users monitor plant health and demonstrates how projects can thrive through community handovers.
- **addon-otmonitor**: This HA add-on packages OpenTherm Monitor for the OpenTherm Gateway (OTGW). Using Docker to simplify deployment, it's become a powerful open-source alternative to Nest or Ecobee, giving full control over heating systems.
- **home-assistant-macbook-touch-bar**: Remember that useless touch bar on the old MacBook? I transformed it into a mini Home Assistant control panel for lights, temperature, and more - a classic case of hardware hacking giving new life to abandoned technology.
- **python-kasa**: To modernize the popular `pyHS100` library for TP-Link devices, I converted it to use `asyncio`. With @rytilahti, we created the `python-kasa` organization through community collaboration. While I haven't contributed much since its inception, it's now the standard for controlling Kasa devices.

## üìä Impact & Lessons

These projects serve thousands of users while teaching valuable lessons:

- Open source empowers us: from KEF speaker integration to plant monitoring
- Reverse engineering unlocks potential: turning proprietary protocols into open solutions
- Community drives success: projects like miflora and python-kasa thrive through collaboration
- Innovation through repurposing: giving new life to hardware like the MacBook Touch Bar
- Modern tech matters: Docker simplifies deployment, async code boosts performance
