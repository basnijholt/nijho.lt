(See my [intro post](../))

When most people think of open source, they think of software. But what about open-sourcing your PhD thesis and creating a generative art system for its cover?

## 📖 Origin Story

With my PhD defense approaching and needing around 100 copies of my thesis, I faced a design challenge. As someone more comfortable with Python than Photoshop, I turned what started as a simple visualization idea into a full-blown generative art project with machine learning-based clustering.

## 🔧 Technical Highlights

- Generated 3,671 unique covers from quantum physics simulation data
- Used VGG16 neural network to extract features from covers
- Implemented K-means clustering to group similar designs
- Created interactive IPywidgets for design selection
- Built a Binder app for real-time color scheme adjustment
- Added unique edition numbers (1/120, 2/120, etc.)
- Made both thesis and cover design code fully open source

The project combines:

- Adaptive sampling for physics simulations
- Neural networks for image feature extraction
- Interactive visualization tools
- Parallel processing for batch generation
- Version control for scientific writing

## 📊 Impact

- Thesis repository: 14 GitHub stars
- Cover design repository: 36 GitHub stars
- Real-world adoption: [Dr. Tomas Pippia from TU Delft](https://repository.tudelft.nl/record/uuid:e88a1897-0033-47e3-8b4f-84fd9cd5eec0) used the code to create his own thesis cover
- ~100 unique printed copies, each with its own generated cover and edition number

## 🎯 Challenges and Solutions

- Managing 3,671 unique PDF files and their conversions
- Creating a clustering system for visually similar designs
- Building interactive tools for non-technical collaborators
- Ensuring consistent print quality across designs
- Balancing artistic appeal with scientific relevance

## 💡 Lessons Learned

1. Open source isn't just about code - it's about sharing knowledge
2. Python can be a powerful tool for creative projects
3. Machine learning can help solve unexpected problems
4. Good visualization requires both technical skill and artistic sense
5. Interactive tools make collaboration with non-programmers easier

## 📚 Fun Fact

Due to COVID restrictions, I defended my thesis without any guests present. The silver lining? I still have about 100 beautifully unique copies at home, each with a different generated cover and edition number. If you'd like a physical copy of this piece of quantum physics meets generative art, just let me know!
