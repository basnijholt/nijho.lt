# 🎄🎁 Advent of Open Source – Day 23/24: pfapack 🔢

(See my [intro post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/basnijholt_advent-of-open-source-celebrating-activity-7269075513002909697-M89J))

Ever needed to calculate the square root of the determinant of a skew-symmetric matrix? Probably not, but if you're in quantum physics, you might have! This is called the Pfaffian. Today's project, `pfapack`, is a Python package that provides efficient routines for computing it. The underlying algorithms and original code implementations were developed by my PhD co-promotor Michael Wimmer. I created the `pfapack` package to make this powerful tool easily accessible.

## 📖 Origin Story

Working in quantum physics, I frequently need to compute the Pfaffian. Michael had not only developed the algorithms but also wrote highly optimized C, FORTRAN, and Python implementations, distributing them as a tar file [on his website](https://michaelwimmer.org/downloads.html). To make it easier for researchers working in Python, I packaged his existing Python code, added wrappers for his C and FORTRAN implementations, and set up automated builds for PyPI and conda-forge to make it easily installable.

## 🔧 Technical Highlights

* **Python Wrapper for Efficient Code:** User-friendly Python interface to Wimmer's optimized C and FORTRAN.
* **Multiple Algorithms:** Supports both the Parlett-Reid and Householder methods.
* **Optimized for Performance:** Leverages low-level optimizations for speed.
* **Conda and Pip Installable:** Easy installation via `conda-forge` and PyPI.
* **Automated Wheel Builds:** Uses `pypa/cibuildwheel` for streamlined, automated builds and releases.
* **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows (with some caveats).

## 📊 Impact

* Makes specialized mathematical algorithms readily available to Python users.
* Simplifies the use of highly optimized code.
* 15 GitHub stars.
* Used in research projects that require efficient Pfaffian computations, particularly in quantum physics.

## 🎯 Challenges and Solutions

* **Bridging Languages:** Wrapping C and FORTRAN for Python integration.
* **Automated Builds:** Setting up automated builds for multiple platforms was complex.
* **Windows Compatibility:** As always Windows support is a PITA; it currently requires MSYS2 and MinGW64.

## 💡 Lessons Learned

* Making specialized tools accessible broadens their impact.
* Wrapping low-level code in Python can improve usability.
* Automated builds are essential for maintainability.
* `pypa/cibuildwheel` is awesome for cross-platform builds.

## 🙏 Credits

All the credits for the underlying algorithms and original code implementations go to Michael Wimmer. I simply made it easier to distribute and use in Python.
