# 🎄🎁 Advent of Open Source – Day 20/24: pipefunc 🕸️

(See my [intro post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/basnijholt_advent-of-open-source-celebrating-activity-7269075513002909697-M89J))

Of all the projects I'm sharing this month, this one that started as a passion project excites me the most!

## 📖 Origin Story

Sometimes the best projects are born from the most unexpected moments. More than 1½ year ago, while on parental leave with my twin boys, I found myself with small pockets of time during naps to work on a problem that had been bothering me for years: the tedious bookkeeping required in complex computational workflows. Every scientific computation project seemed to reinvent the same patterns - managing function dependencies, parameter sweeps, result caching, parallelization, and a lot of boilerplate to combine the resulting data. I wanted something that would let scientists focus on their science, not on pipeline management.

## 🔧 Technical Highlights

* Automatic DAG construction via very simple and lightweight syntax
* N-dimensional parameter sweeps with automatic parallelization
* Visual pipeline representation using NetworkX
* Resource profiling (CPU, memory, time)
* Type validation between pipeline stages
* Ultra-fast: only 15 µs overhead per function
* Flexible caching strategies (memory, disk, cloud)
* Integration with scientific computing tools:
  * NetworkX for graph algorithms
  * NumPy for multi-dimensional arrays
  * Xarray for labeled arrays
  * Zarr for distributed storage
  * Adaptive for parallel computing

## 📊 Impact

* 230 GitHub stars
* >600 tests with 100% coverage
* Fully typed codebase
* Comprehensive documentation
* Tested on real workflow on SLURM cluster
* Covered on Pycoder's Weekly with >100k subscribers

## 🎯 Challenges and Solutions

* Balancing simplicity with power
* Making complex workflows intuitive
* Handling distributed computing edge cases
* Ensuring type safety across the pipeline
* Optimizing performance without sacrificing features

## 💡 Lessons Learned

1. Sometimes the best time to code is during baby naps
2. Complex problems can have elegant solutions
3. Scientific computing needs better tooling
4. Good abstractions make hard things easy
5. Type hints and tests prevent headaches

## 🔮 Future Plans

The journey is far from over. Plans include:
* Enhanced cloud computing support
* More interactive visualization options
* Interactive pipeline debugging tools
* Expanded parameter sweep capabilities
