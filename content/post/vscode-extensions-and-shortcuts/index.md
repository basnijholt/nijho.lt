Visual Studio Code, or VSCode, has rapidly become one of the most popular code editors available today, and for good reason. With a vast amount of development activity behind it, VSCode is a powerful and extensible platform that allows users to customize it to their needs through a wide variety of extensions. As a long-time Sublime Text user, I was initially skeptical about making the switch due to concerns about performance. However, as I spent more time using VSCode, I became convinced of its many benefits and have since made it my go-to editor for all my development needs, particularly for Python.

In this blog post, I will share my personal setup for turbocharging Python development in VSCode, including my favorite extensions and most-used keystrokes. By tailoring your editor to your specific requirements and preferences, you can maximize productivity and minimize keystrokes, making your development experience as smooth and efficient as possible.

## My most common Shortcuts

Personally, I use the Sublime Keymap extension to add Sublime Text keybindings to VSCode.

It is a valuable extension for those who are transitioning from Sublime Text to Visual Studio Code or simply prefer Sublime Text's keybindings.
This extension replicates Sublime Text's keyboard shortcuts in VSCode, allowing you to maintain your productivity and muscle memory.

Here are ***my*** commonly used shortcuts when using the Sublime Keymap extension and the default VSCode keybindings (if missing both are the same):

| Keybinding (Sublime)                                       | Keybinding (VS Code)                                       | Description                                                                                                                                                             |
