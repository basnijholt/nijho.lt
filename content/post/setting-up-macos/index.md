## Introduction

Setting up a new MacOS installation can be a tedious process. This blog post will guide you through the essential steps and applications to install when setting up your fresh MacOS environment.
I'll cover a few unavoidable manual installations, homebrew, iTerm and VS Code font, oh-my-zsh, but can automate most other things.

> Note that this is just what I have been doing for the last years, and you might want to do things differently.

This post is based on a GitHub Gist I have been maintaining since 2015-03 with >160 revisions by now, see it at [`basnijholt/install-fresh-macOS.md`](https://gist.github.com/basnijholt/2df9845af97c69811b44)

## 1. Manual Installations

First, let's manually install some essential tools and software:

1.  [homebrew](https://brew.sh/), the essential package manager for MacOS
2.  [micromamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#micromamba), my preferred conda package manager which is blazingly fast
3.  [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) (manual install because the brew version doesn't work with 1Password)
4.  [File-up](https://github.com/basnijholt/fileup), a simple tool I made to upload files to an FTP server and copy the URL to the clipboard **(optional)**

Set a [`host`](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts) file to block unwanted websites and advertisements.

## 2. Homebrew
