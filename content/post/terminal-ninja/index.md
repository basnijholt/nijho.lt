Welcome to a world of terminal productivity!
When helping others with programming problems on their computer, I often find myself in their terminal, and feel like walking through sand.
When I show how awesome of an experience it can be, I often find myself repeating the same suggestions over and over again.
So, I decided to write this guide to help others set up their terminal in a similar fashion.
Let's explore the wonders of [`zsh`](https://www.zsh.org/), [`oh-my-zsh`](https://ohmyz.sh/), [`keychain`](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Keychain), [`starship`](https://starship.rs/), [`autoenv`](https://github.com/hyperupcall/autoenv), [`z`](https://github.com/agkozak/zsh-z), [`zsh-autosuggestions`](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions), and other useful tools!

## üíæ Dotfiles: Version Control Your Configuration Files

Configuration files are the key to a personalized terminal experience.
Keeping a `dotfiles` folder where you store and version control your config files ensures they're safe, portable, and easily shared.

By keeping your `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, and other configuration files under version control, you can:

1.  Track changes and easily revert to previous versions if something breaks.
2.  Sync your settings across multiple machines, recreating your setup anywhere.
3.  Share your configurations with others, helping them improve their own terminal experience.

A powerful approach is to not only track your configuration files but also to include plugins and tools as git submodules in your dotfiles repository. This keeps everything organized and makes it easy to update or share your complete setup.

Here's an example of submodules I track in my dotfiles repository:

```bash
[submodule "configs/zsh/oh-my-zsh"]
	path = submodules/oh-my-zsh
	url = git@github.com:robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh.git
[submodule "configs/zsh/zsh-syntax-highlighting"]
	path = submodules/zsh-syntax-highlighting
	url = git@github.com:zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git
[submodule "configs/zsh/zsh-autosuggestions"]
	path = submodules/zsh-autosuggestions
	url = git@github.com:zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions.git
[submodule "submodules/keychain"]
	path = submodules/keychain
	url = git@github.com:funtoo/keychain.git
[submodule "configs/zsh/k"]
	path = submodules/k
	url = git@github.com:supercrabtree/k.git
[submodule "submodules/.tmux"]
	path = submodules/tmux
	url = https://github.com/gpakosz/.tmux.git
[submodule "configs/zsh/autoenv"]
	path = submodules/autoenv
	url = https://github.com/hyperupcall/autoenv
[submodule "submodules/bypass-paywalls-chrome"]
	path = submodules/bypass-paywalls-chrome
	url = git@github.com:iamadamdev/bypass-paywalls-chrome.git
[submodule "submodules/dotbot"]
	path = submodules/dotbot
	url = https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot
[submodule "dotbot"]
	ignore = dirty
# (... a couple more ...)
```

To start version controlling your dotfiles, create a new Git repository, add your config files and submodules, then commit and push to a remote repository for safekeeping.

[Dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) is highly recommended for automating the installation of your dotfiles.

Although I keep my dotfiles in a Git repository, I have not made it public. I might do so in the future, let me know if you're interested!

## üêö The Power of Zsh and Oh-my-zsh

The first step toward terminal efficiency is choosing the right shell.
Zsh is a powerful, versatile, and user-friendly shell with features that significantly improve the command line experience.
Oh-my-zsh adds even more functionality as a framework for managing Zsh configurations.
It brings themes, plugins, and functions that make the terminal more powerful and enjoyable to use.

Setting up Zsh and Oh-my-zsh is straightforward:

1.  Install Zsh (check your system's package manager for instructions).
2.  Install Oh-my-zsh by running:
    
    ```bash
    sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
    ```
    
3.  Edit your `.zshrc` file and add the following lines to customize your plugins and theme:
    
    ```bash
    ZSH_THEME="robbyrussell" # or any other theme you like
    plugins=(git z dirhistory history sudo)
    ```

## üöÄ Oh-my-zsh Z Plugin: Jump Around!

Quick navigation through the file system is essential for productivity.
[Z](https://github.com/agkozak/zsh-z) is a fantastic utility that lets you jump to directories based on frequency and recency of use.
With Z, you can instantly leap to any frequently-used folder without typing the full path.

To set up Z, add the following lines to your `.zshrc`:

```bash
plugins=(... z ...)
source $ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh
```

![](https://github.com/agkozak/zsh-z/raw/da8dee3ccaf882d1bf653c34850041025616ceb5/img/demo.gif)

Alternative: [zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide), a more modern and faster version of Z in Rust.
Need to try it myself.

## ‚è∞ Oh-my-zsh Dirhistory Plugin: Time Travel Through Directories

The `dirhistory` plugin makes navigating directories incredibly simple with keyboard shortcuts:

*   **ALT-LEFT**: Move back to previously visited directories.
*   **ALT-RIGHT**: Undo the effect of ALT-LEFT, returning to the directories you moved back from.
*   **ALT-UP**: Move up one level in the directory hierarchy (equivalent to `cd ..`).
*   **ALT-DOWN**: Move into the first directory found in alphabetical order within the current directory.

To set up the Oh-my-zsh `dirhistory` plugin, add the following lines to your `.zshrc`:

```bash
plugins=(... dirhistory ...)
source $ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh
```

This plugin makes directory navigation a breeze, reducing the need for repetitive typing.

## üîß Oh-my-zsh Git Plugin: Turbocharge Your Git Workflow

For developers who use Git frequently, typing out full commands like `git checkout` and `git commit` gets tedious.
[The `git` plugin](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/5d3e86e2a48adf7a308773f8f1b725d187c7c5ef/plugins/git#git-plugin) in Oh-my-zsh provides useful aliases that save time and keystrokes.
Here are some of the most commonly used aliases:

*   `gco`: `git checkout` - Switch branches or restore working tree files.
*   `gd`: `git diff` - Show changes between the working tree and the index or a tree.
*   `g`: `git` - The git command itself.
*   `gcb`: `git checkout -b` - Create a new branch and switch to it.
*   `gc`: `git commit --verbose` - Create a new commit with a verbose message.
*   `gc!`: `git commit --verbose --amend` - Amend the previous commit with a verbose message.
*   `ga`: git add - Add file contents to the index.
*   `gca`: `git commit --verbose --all` - Commit all changes with a verbose message.
*   `gca!`: `git commit --verbose --all --amend` - Amend the previous commit with a verbose message.
*   `gcp`: `git cherry-pick` - Apply the changes introduced by some existing commits.
*   `gst`: `git status` - Show the working tree status.
*   `gp`: `git push` - Update remote refs along with associated objects.
*   `gmom`: `git merge origin/$(git_main_branch)` - Merge changes from the main branch.
*   `grbom`: `git rebase origin/$(git_main_branch)` - Rebase current branch onto the main branch.
*   `gfa`: `git fetch --all --prune --jobs=10` - Fetch all remote branches and remove any stale remote-tracking references, using 10 parallel jobs.

To set up the Oh-my-zsh `git` plugin, add the following lines to your `.zshrc`:

```bash
plugins=(... git ...)
source $ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh
```

Check out the full list of [Git aliases](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/5d3e86e2a48adf7a308773f8f1b725d187c7c5ef/plugins/git#git-plugin) that the Git plugin provides.

## üîë Keychain: SSH Key Management Made Simple

[Keychain](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Keychain) is a tool that manages SSH keys, making secure access to remote systems much more convenient.
It's especially useful when working with Git repositories or remote servers via SSH.

With Keychain, you only need to ***enter your SSH password once*** after rebooting, and it will remember it for future sessions.

To set up Keychain, clone it to your dotfiles directory:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:funtoo/keychain.git ~/dotfiles/keychain
```

Then add these lines to your `.bash_profile`:

```bash
if [[ `hostname` == 'Linux' ]]; then
    export PATH="$PATH:${HOME}/dotfiles/dotfiles/keychain/"
    if ps -p $SSH_AGENT_PID > /dev/null; then
        echo "ssh-agent is already running"
    else
        eval `keychain --eval --quiet id_ed25519`
    fi
fi
if [[ `uname` == 'Darwin' ]]; then
    eval `keychain --eval --quiet --agents ssh --inherit any-once id_ed25519`
fi
```

## üåå Starship: A Sleek, Informative Shell Prompt

[Starship](https://starship.rs/) is a minimal, blazing-fast, and fully customizable shell prompt that provides essential information at a glance.
It shows details about your current environment, such as Git branch, Python virtual environment, and more.

Setting up Starship is simple:

1.  Install it using the appropriate command for your system:
    
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://starship.rs/install.sh | bash
    ```
    
2.  Add the following line to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`:
    
    ```bash
    eval "$(starship init zsh)"
    ```

<video controls>
  <source src="https://starship.rs/demo.webm" type="video/webm">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

## üåç Autoenv: Smart Environment Management

When working with multiple projects, each often requires specific environment settings.
[Autoenv](https://github.com/hyperupcall/autoenv) automates the process of activating and deactivating these settings when you enter or leave a directory.

For example, you can create a `.env` file in your project directory to automatically activate a Python environment:

```bash
conda activate myenv
```

To set up Autoenv:

1.  Clone the repository (or add it to your `dotfiles`):
    
    ```bash
    git clone git://github.com/hyperupcall/autoenv.git ~/.autoenv
    ```
    
2.  Add the following line to your `.zshrc`:
    
    ```bash
    source ~/.autoenv/activate.sh
    ```

## üí° Zsh-autosuggestions: Command Suggestions as You Type

[Zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions) suggests commands based on your command history as you type.
This saves keystrokes and makes repetitive tasks much faster.

To set up Zsh-autosuggestions:

1.  Clone the repository:
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions.git $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions
    ```
    
2.  Add the following line to your `.zshrc`:
    
    ```bash
    source $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions/zsh-autosuggestions.zsh
    ```

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6897215/233818577-189256ff-b1e2-4790-984e-6fd191df5c00.gif)

Alternative: [`direnv`](https://direnv.net/), very similar to `autoenv`, but seems more widely used.
Still need to try it myself.

## ü¶á Bat: A Supercharged Cat Alternative

[Bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) is a modern replacement for the `cat` command with syntax highlighting, Git integration, and other enhancements that make viewing files in the terminal much more pleasant.

Installing Bat is straightforward with most package managers:

```bash
brew install bat # macOS
apt install bat # Ubuntu/Debian
```

To seamlessly replace `cat` with `bat` while maintaining the simple behavior when needed, add this to your `.zshrc`:

```bash
if command -v bat &> /dev/null; then
    alias cat="bat --plain --paging=never"
fi
```

This alias makes `bat` behave like `cat` by default (without line numbers or fancy formatting), but you can still use the `bat` command directly when you want the enhanced features.

Bat is particularly useful when viewing code files, configuration files, or any text that benefits from syntax highlighting, making it easier to quickly understand the content at a glance.
