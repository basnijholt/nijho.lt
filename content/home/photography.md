I enjoy traveling and photography. The best photos I would like to to share with the world, however, the problem is that I am to lazy to do so, therefore I wrote a program that will do that job for me: [`instacron` <em class="fa fa-github"> </em>](https://github.com/basnijholt/instacron). It takes a photo, adds a _random_ quote, camera and location info, and related hastags.
