I enjoy traveling and photography.
The best photos I would like to to share with the world, however, the problem is that I am to lazy to do so, therefore I wrote a program ([`instacron` <em class="fab fa-github"> </em>](https://github.com/basnijholt/instacron)) that will do that job for me.
It takes a photo and adds: a _random_ quote, camera and location info, and #hashtags related to the photo.
