I *really* enjoy taking nice photos and those I like to share with the world. The problem was that I didn't do that, so I wrote a program that will do that job for me: [`instacron` <em class="fa fa-github"> </em>](https://github.com/basnijholt/instacron). It takes a photo, adds a **random** quote, camera and location info, and related hastags.
