# Biography


Hi, my name is Bas. I am a PhD student in theoretical quantum mechanics, Python and [open-source](https://github.com/basnijholt) enthusiast, and full-time nerd.

Click [here](https://500px.com/basnijholt) are some pretty pictures that I took, [this](http://quantumtinkerer.tudelft.nl/) is where I work, and see my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/basnijholt) for some technical details on my life.
