Hi all,

Due to [external circumstances](https://lmgtfy.com/?q=corona+crisis) my Ph.D. defense will be happening without a live audience.
Only my professor ([Anton Akhmerov](https://antonakhmerov.org/)), the chairman, [Beadle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beadle), Marcella, and I will be physically at the TU Delft.
The other professors in my committee will be calling in using Skype.

I will organize a live-stream myself, which I will link on this page.

The relevant links are:

- My thesis: [`thesis.pdf`](http://files.nijho.lt/thesis.pdf)
- My propositions/stellingen: [`propositions.pdf`](http://files.nijho.lt/propositions.pdf)
- Link to the live-stream: [live-stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0) (**STILL NEED TO ADD THIS!!!!**)

Hope to see you there, at May 11, 2020 at 15:00!
